Listens for XkbBellNotify events and plays corresponding beeps via ALSA device.

Xwayland and some Xorg configurations seem to be unable to play beeps on their own.

This utility plays beeps directly to default ALSA device, so beeps can be played
on any system where ALSA configuration works. Sound servers like pulseaudio or
pipewire usually implement ALSA plugin, so these should work as well.

The X bells are used for example by xterm and OCaml Graphics modules sound function.

The asound2 and x11 libraries are needed for compilation
(on Debian run apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev).

Compilation: sh xbeep.c
